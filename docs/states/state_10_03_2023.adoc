-> Added *RoomDB* including Dagger-Hilt

* *Navigation*:
** Added simple Navigation with the "Tabs"-Component
** This is an alternative to a more complex Navigation implementation, but it also works for simple usage

* *RooomDB*:
** Added a Database to the Android App - it is used to store the "data of the user";
** The user can *like* an author and the app will show the liked authors in the *Liked Authors* section

* *Dagger-Hilt*:
** "Dagger-Hilt" is a Dependency used for _Dependency Injection_
** I used Dagger-Hilt to inject the `Database` into the `ViewModel`
