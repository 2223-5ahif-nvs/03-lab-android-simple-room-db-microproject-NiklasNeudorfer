## Current State

* I've added Tabs, so I can display 2 different Screens, and navigate between them very easily

* I can get data from my local Endpoint and display it on the Emulator

    * I created a new Project, so I can start from scratch and not have to deal with the old code where I encountered an
      error which I don't know how to fix at the moment.
